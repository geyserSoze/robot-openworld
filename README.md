# robot-openworld

This is an open world game where you play as a shotgun-wielding samurai, wandering a vast desert/field killing robots and trying to figure out the mysteries of the land.

It's in early development (obviously) so many things are just ideas/tests. Virtually no art is final or even complete, and goal number one right now is to get the gameplay down. The story, art, and music will come later!
